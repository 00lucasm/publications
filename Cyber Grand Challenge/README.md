# The DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge

We built an autonomous robot to fight and destroy insecure software as part of a DARPA competition. It uses symbolic execution, fuzzing, binary translation, dynamic instrumentation, and more to identify and fix vulnerabilities without any human guidance. We will describe the high-level architecture of our system, how well it works, and difficulties we overcame during the development process.
